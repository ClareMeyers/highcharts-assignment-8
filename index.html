	<h2>The Realtionship Between Journalism and PR</h2>

	<p>
        Journalism and public relations (PR) are two closely related yet distinct majors offered by the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications. Both rely heavily on writing and communications skills, however, their core objectives differ: Journalists report impartial, accurate information to the public, while PR professionals focus on building and maintaining positive relationships between a client and the client's publics. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Both jobs are essential to the media industry, however, in recent years a large percent of journalists have been switching fields, or “joining the dark side,” to become public relations professionals. This trend is often attributed to the increased job stability, higher earning potential, transferable skills, diverse career opportunities, and a less demanding work environment that the PR sector provides.

	<h2>Employment in Both Industries Since 2016</h2>

	<p>In 2016, the journalism field employed approximately 45,160 individuals, while public relations had around 226,940 professionals. Since then, journalism has seen a slight relative decline in the number of employed journalists, which can be attributed to shifts in the media landscape, including the digitalization of news and industry-wide layoffs. On the contrary, public relations has been on the rise, with a notable increase in employment. These trends indicate a significant transition within the media industry, explaining why more professionals opt for public relations careers over traditional journalism.
